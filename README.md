# Holiday_Cost_Calculator
Program develop to estimate the price of a holiday trip depending on destination, hotel nights and days of car rental.

User would be prompted to select a destination between 4 options, in this case: New York, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro y Mexico City. 
These 4 options can be changed for different cities if required, simply needs to be changed in variable: "city_flight".

After that user would be prompted to select how many holiday nights for hotel stay and how many days for car rental.

Note that price for flights, hotel night and car rental days it is being assigned randomly. All of this could be changed to requirements of the travel company using the program in their respect variables inside code.
stay_cost = num_nights * "price to set".
flight_cost = "price to set" (different prices for different destinations).
rental_cost = rental_days * "price to set".

The output it would be the price of each separate part of the holidays and the total price overall.
